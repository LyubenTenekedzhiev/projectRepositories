# projectRepositories
Here you can have a look at some of my past work. Enjoy!

## Installation
After choosing a project, which you want to visit, open its repository by clicking the given link. Find the green button "clone or download" and copy the link from there. Create a new folder, navigate to it with your terminal and execute:
```terminal
git clone  PasteTheCopiedLinkHere
```
After the repository is cloned on your local machine, install the dependencies and run the starting scripts:
```terminal
yarn/npm install
```
```terminal
if(gulp)  gulp watch || npm/yarn run watch; 
if(react)  yarn/npm start
```
